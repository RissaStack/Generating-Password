# Generating-Password

## Decription

This project was done to add Javascript to the given code. Adding Javascript allowed the password generator to function properly using loops, conditional statements, math equations, and alerts.  

## Challenges

Some of the challenges I faced were getting the length of the password to be recognized. I used Google and Dev to figure out that i needed to use a while loop and space each conditional statment out to it's own line in order to work. I still need to work with loops to fully understand the difference between a for loop and a while loop.
